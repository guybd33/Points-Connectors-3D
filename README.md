Written in Python , The purpose of the project is to connect 3 start points to 3 ending points, 
when no line between the points is allowed to touch each other. The project is carried out in three dimensions, where 
each start and ending point has an initial (x, y), and it can move from z = 0 to z = 1 if necessary. 

On the right side of the screen, you will find an downloadable EXE file (at the Releases section - Final Release)
